## [1.15.1-atlassian-5] - 2025-08-13

### Fixed
- [DCA11Y-2101]: Node should actually be used from the version manager instead of whatever happened to be on the `PATH` environment variable when running `yarn`, `bower`, `corepack`, `ember`, `grunt`, `gulp`, `jspm`, `karma`, `npx`, & `pnpm` commands (Yarn, Bower, Corepack, .... Mojos).

## [1.15.1-atlassian-4] - 2025-08-11

### Added
- [DCA11Y-1145]: Added support for using already installed node from default install directory of node version manager (fnm, mise, asdf, nvm, nvs). Use of version manager is enabled by default and can be controlled with `useNodeVersionManager` configuration property.
- [DCA11Y-1145]: Added support for explicitly defining node installation directory with `installedNodeDirectory` configuration property or `AFMP_INSTALLED_NODE_DIRECTORY` environment variable.

### Changed
- [DCA11Y-1145]: `nodeVersion` property is not required any more, if `useNodeVersionManager` is not set to false

### Fixed
- [DCA11Y-1504]: Local mise configuration files have now precedence over global ones
