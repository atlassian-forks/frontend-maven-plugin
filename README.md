# Atlassian fork of "frontend-maven-plugin"

[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE) ![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)

## Intro

First read the upstream [README](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin)

## Purpose

There are a few changes that are not wanted upstream, but are useful to developing for Atlassian products

## Goals

* Make it as easy as possible to use without subverting expectations
* Keep in sync with upstream
* Upstream as much as possible

## Issues, Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution! Pull requests, issues and comments are welcome. 

Please try to contribute upstream first. It maximises the value out of every change and keeps this fork easier to maintain. You can check [upstream's issue tracker](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin/pulls) to gauge maintainer opinion and avoid duplicate work.

Please minimise changes to the upstream code to keep syncing with upstream easy.

For pull requests, please:

* Add tests for new features and bug fixes
* Follow the existing style
* Separate unrelated changes into multiple pull requests

See the existing issues for things to start contributing.

For bigger changes, please make sure you start a discussion first by creating an issue and explaining the intended change.

Atlassian requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement, known as a CLA.

### Releasing

Only Atlassians may release a new version, [follow this guide](https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~278062200/pages/1407390489/HOW+TO+Do+a+manual+maven+artifact+release).

## Usage requirements

* Java 8, until support is dropped from all DC products ([currently projected for 2026-04-19](https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DCCore/pages/3989804253/When+can+I+stop+supporting+Java+8+11+entirely+in+DC))
* Maven 3.6 (because of upstream)

## Usage guidance

### Using Node Version Manager

By default, node based goals will try to use one of supported node version managers (`fnm`, `mise`, `asdf`, `nvm`, `nvs`) to install node and to find npm. You can disable node version manager usage with `useNodeVersionManager` configuration property.

If you're using `fnm`, make sure to have `--version-file-strategy=recursive` enabled in your shell profile file so that fnm can find node version files in higher levels of the project.

#### Known limitations

1. Windows platform is not supported as of this moment.
2. Bitbucket pipelines hijack /bin/bash stdout and so internal commands needed to determine whether node version manager is available or not don't work.

### Format of the Node version

It shouldn't matter if the `v` prefix is present, e.g. `14.8.0` and `v14.8.0`.

Old, non-standard, and codename versions are also supported if they're [available](https://nodejs.org/dist), e.g. `latest-v12.x`.

### Using Node version files

The plugin should automatically detect the version from files like: `.node-version`, `.nvmrc`, and `.tool-versions`. Comments in the files should be ignored. If the file is not in the working directory, nor any of the parent directories, it can be manually set in the configuration like so:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.github.eirslett</groupId>
    <artifactId>frontend-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <nodeVersionFile>${project.basedir}/dotfiles/.nvmrc</nodeVersionFile>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```
